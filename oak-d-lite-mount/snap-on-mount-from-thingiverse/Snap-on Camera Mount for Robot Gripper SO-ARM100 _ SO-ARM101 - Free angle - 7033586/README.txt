Snap-on Camera Mount for Robot Gripper SO-ARM100 / SO-ARM101 - Free angle by Starkosaure on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7033586

Summary:
I didn’t want to reprint the entire gripper just to get a decent camera mount, and I was unsure if compatible with my camera. So I designed one that fits directly, and it should be compatible with all cameras of this kind.✅ No modifications✅ No drilling, no glue.✅ Quick to install✅ Adjustable camera angleThe design includes a pivot joint, allowing you to adjust the camera angle freely to suit your needs.Compatible with 28 × 28 mm  and   27 × 31 mm  camera’s mounting hole spacing.Mounting method:The bracket clips directly onto the gripper, and is then secured in place using a 20 mm wood screw. As the screw goes in, it pushes the jaws apart slightly, ensuring a tight grip on the gripper without needing to drill, damage, or modify anything.Bill of Materials (see picture for reference):--&gt; To fix the camera:    4x small plastic screws (the ones usually supplied with servos),--&gt; To secure the fixation on the gripper:    1x wood screw, 20 mm long,--&gt; To secure the pivot   1x M4 screw, 15mm long, 1x M4 nut.The mount is designed to fit snugly and hold the camera firmly in place without altering the original gripper. Perfect for quick prototyping or upgrading your robot arm with vision capability.https://github.com/huggingface/lerobotHappy training!
